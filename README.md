<!--
The snake animation above is dynamically generated by a GitHub Action.
You can view the workflow configuration at:
[.github/workflows/generate_snake.yml](.github/workflows/generate_snake.yml)
The Action will commit the updated snake to the `output` branch of this repository (or as configured in the workflow).
Ensure your repository settings allow workflows to write to the repository if you modify it.
